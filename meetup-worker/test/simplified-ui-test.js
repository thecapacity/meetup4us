/**
 * Simplified UI Test Instructions
 * 
 * Test the new simplified interface without mode switching:
 * 
 * 1. Open http://localhost:8080
 * 2. Notice the clean, simple interface:
 *    - "Search" heading at top
 *    - One search bar with placeholder "Enter address or search for places..."
 *    - "Planning List" below that
 *    - NO buttons, NO mode indicators
 * 
 * Test Cases:
 * 
 * A. ADDRESS SEARCH:
 *    - Type "123 Main St, New York" 
 *    - Select from autocomplete or press Enter
 *    - Should add blue marker to map and item to Planning List
 * 
 * B. POI SEARCH:
 *    - Type "Starbucks" or "Pizza Hut"
 *    - Select a specific business from autocomplete
 *    - Should add red marker to map and item to Planning List
 * 
 * C. MIXED PLANNING:
 *    - Add both addresses and POIs to same list
 *    - Both should appear in Planning List
 *    - Both should be in URL parameters (?addy=...&poi=...)
 * 
 * D. REMOVAL:
 *    - Click X on any item in Planning List
 *    - Should remove from map and URL
 * 
 * E. URL SHARING:
 *    - Copy URL with mixed addresses/POIs
 *    - Open in new tab - should load all items
 * 
 * Key Benefits:
 * - No confusing mode switching
 * - One search bar does everything
 * - Cleaner, simpler interface
 * - Everything in one unified Planning List
 * - URL sharing still works perfectly
